This repository contains a Python script for performing Logistic Regression analysis using the Iris dataset. Logistic Regression is a statistical method for predicting binary outcomes.

# Features

Loads the Iris dataset

Performs data preprocessing (standardization, train-test split)

Trains a Logistic Regression model

Evaluates model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

Visualizes the confusion matrix

# Requirements

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

Usage

Run the Python script to perform logistic regression analysis:

python logistic_regression.py

# Output

Model accuracy

Confusion matrix

Classification report

Confusion matrix visualization
